A programm for rendering my [Workshop Plan](https://github.com/Tagirijus/workshopplan) file to ODT with `secretary`.

# Usage

`python3 run.py -f [WPLAN_FILE]` will create a `PDF` with the same new like the `.wplan` file in the same folder. Optional `-t [ODT template file]` can be assigned to not use the default ODT from the repo. Look into the ODT to see how the variable-replacements should look like.

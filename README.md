A programm for rendering my [Workshop Plan](https://github.com/Tagirijus/workshopplan) file to PDF with `weasyprint`.

# Usage

`python3 run.py -f [WPLAN_FILE]` will create a `PDF` with the same new like the `.wplan` file in the same folder. Optional `-t [HTML template file]` can be assigned to not use the defualt HTML from the repo. Look into the HTML to see how the variable-replacements should look like.
